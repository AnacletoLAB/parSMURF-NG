### Overview
parSMURF-NG is a fast and scalable C++ implementation of the HyperSMURF algorithm - hyper-ensemble of SMOTE Undersampled Random Forests - an ensemble approach explicitly designed to deal with the huge imbalance between deleterious and neutral variants.

The algorithm is outlined in the following papers:\

Valentini, "parSMURF, a High Performance Computing tool for the genome-wide detection of pathogenic variants OR parSMURF, a High Performance Computing tool for supervised big data analysis in Genomic Medicine"\
<TBD>

parSMURF-NG is a more stable, faster, more scalable and up-to-date version of parSMURF. Also, usability has been improved.

Proper documentation will be published as soon as possible.
